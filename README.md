## Getting Started

To get started with the **React FastAPI** template, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RAAJSURIYAA/react-fastapi.git
cd react-fastapi
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration variables. Hereâ€™s a sample:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### Build and Run with Docker

To build and run the application using Docker, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will set up the backend and frontend services, along with the PostgreSQL database.

### Access the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Usage

### API Endpoints

The backend API exposes several endpoints. You can explore them using the Swagger UI at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

Here are some example endpoints:

- `GET /items/`: Retrieve all items.
- `POST /items/`: Create a new item.
- `GET /items/{item_id}`: Retrieve a specific item.
- `PUT /items/{item_id}`: Update a specific item.
- `DELETE /items/{item_id}`: Delete a specific item.

### Frontend Components

The frontend consists of various components that utilize Chakra UI for styling. You can find the main components in the `src` directory.

To run the frontend separately, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
